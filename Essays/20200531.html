<h1>Can we promote more focused work with unintuitive UI?</h1>
<p>This essay from Here Be Seaswines voiced a lot of my previous thoughts on UI, and prompted me to think about it in some interesting new ways:</p>

<p>Read the essay at the above link first. My response/thoughts on it are below.</p>

<h3>Response</h3>

<p>The author of this essay likens UI to the alphabet, as a technology that allows us to interact with and create projects/ideas/concepts that aren&#39;t necessarily tied to the technology itself. A novel written using the English alphabet is concerned with events portrayed using the letters of the alphabet, not with the letters themselves. The author also notes that the alphabet is unintuitive&#45;&#45;small children don&#39;t know how to use it until they&#39;ve had practice and training. But eventually, with such effort, the alphabet becomes a tool incredibly well&#45;suited to the job of information transmission. I&#39;d like to pose an alternative and note that pictographs, while extremely intuitive, are not very good at information transmission. They can only represent very basic concepts, and can be easily misinterpreted.</p>

<p>What if our insistence on graphical, intuitive UX amounts to limiting ourselves to using pictographs instead of letters?</p>

<p>This is easy to believe if you&#39;re accustomed to using command-line interfaces (CLIs) like the Command Prompt in Windows or the Terminal in macOS. Many jobs are easier to do in a CLI, and many more powerful tools are natively available in a CLI, but you have to first learn how to use them.</p>

<p>And of course, to use more powerful tools, one often must focus harder. As the author of the essay notes, this is something we seem to be moving away from as a society. Is “intuitive” UX, which panders to a shortened attention span and less focused work, fueling the fire of our inability to deeply focus?</p>

<p>My mind immediately jumps to WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) text editors. When you need to make a published work look professional or polished for some image-related reason, you&#39;re of course going to use a WYSIWYG editor, because in that case how the content looks is as important as (if not more important than) the content itself. But when you&#39;re writing strictly for the content, strictly for the most effective and efficient means of information-relay, then WYSIWYG is distracting and annoying, and obfuscates the core elements you need when interacting with word-processing technology (e.g. embedding links, footnotes and references). I&#39;d never thought of it strictly in this way before, but I now realize that when I have serious writing to do, I often pull out a plaintext notepad app and use Markdown for formatting. The same with reading&#45;&#45;I&#39;m perpetually in &quot;Reading Mode&quot; when reading in a browser.</p>

<p>All the above leaves me with a lot of thoughts to mull over. When tinkering around with personal programming projects, I tend to get hung up on the GUI&#45;I don&#39;t have much talent in visual design realms, and it seems that whenever I try to put my ideas in visual format, it obscures the content I&#39;m trying to produce, rather than augmenting it. If there&#39;s one major issue that keeps me from completing projects, this is it. Can I forgo the visual elements altogether? Is it possible to avoid GUI and come out with a better product on the other side?</p>

<p>When I look at the tools I rely on (Terminal, Markdown, Notepad, Brackets, git in Terminal, Reading Mode), I realize that I gravitate toward the tools which favor direct text input/output, even if they require a bit of studying first, because I find them more immersive and more powerful. It&#39;s a shift in thinking for me, but maybe UI can be something better than just &quot;intuitive.&quot;</p>

<p>Update: a friend also made me realize that a non-graphical UI is naturally more accessible, by being more easily parsed by screen&#45;readers, though GUIs can also be made accessible with markup.</p>
