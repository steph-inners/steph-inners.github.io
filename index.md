### Which line-art tools can be used under Copics without smearing?
When you’re planning to color your piece in Copics or other alcohol markers, your line tool must be alcohol-resistant. Alcohol-based inks (e.g. Sakura Pigma, Speedball pigmented acrylic) and most inks designed to be water-resistant will smear.

Some Copic-safe options include…
1. Copic Gasenfude brush pen (beware of long dry times)
2. Water-based Tombow ABT brush markers
3. Pilot Iroshizuku Takesumi black ink (safe for fountain pens)
4. [Noodler’s Bulletproof Black ink](https://noodlersink.com/about-us/noodlers-durable-ink-classification/) (water-resistant and safe for fountain pens)
5. Yasutomo Black Sumi ink (and, presumably, other similar soot-based sumi inks). Quick-drying and water-resistant when dry.

## Miscellany
### Day hike itinerary
A printable PDF I created for day hikes. I always make 3 copies:
- 1 copy to leave with an emergency contact
- 1 copy to leave (folded) in the car at the trailhead for park authorities
- 1 copy to take on the trail to stay on schedule and on route

It also helps with planning. Please use it, and be safe out there :)

### Recipes I make when my parents are over for dinner
These recipes serve (at least) 4 people and still taste good with onions, garlic, and mushrooms removed (allergies are a bummer). I get garlic-free and onion-free stocks, sauces and dressings from [Fody Foods](https://www.fodyfoods.com/)

- Chicken saltimbocca; from Trisha’s Table; by Trisha Yearwood; pg 108
- Fettuccine Alfredo with Salmon and asparagus; from The Joy of Cooking; by Irma S Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, and Ethan Becker; pg 327

### Why is your personal website just one big Markdown doc?
**It’s lightweight and easy to update**

What it says on the tin. Unnecessarily bloated websites are exhausting to maintain *and view*.

**It’s free**

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), which natively supports Markdown (.md) files with readable styling out of the box. I highly recommend it for a no-frills content delivery platform, especially if you’re familiar with or want to learn git.

For a free service with more frills (functionality), I recommend [Wordpress.com](wordpress.com). Wordpress is likely better for typical blogging or online portfolio needs.

**It’s a perfectionism blocker**

When everything is in one giant, ever-growing Markdown document, nothing will ever be beautiful and presentable. When nothing is beautiful and presentable, nothing can be unworthy of publishing either. My personality isn’t curated; why should my personal website be so?
