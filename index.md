## Miscellany
### Recipes I make when my parents are over for dinner
These recipes serve (at least) 4 people and still taste good with onions, garlic, and mushrooms removed (allergies are a bummer). I get garlic-free and onion-free stocks, sauces and dressings from [Fody Foods](https://www.fodyfoods.com/)

- Chicken saltimbocca; from Trisha’s Table; by Trisha Yearwood; pg 108
- Fettuccine Alfredo with Salmon and asparagus; from The Joy of Cooking; by Irma S Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, and Ethan Becker; pg 327

### Why is your personal website one giant Markdown doc?
**It’s lightweight and easy to update**

What it says on the tin.

**It’s a perfectionism blocker**

When everything is in one giant, ever-growing Markdown document, nothing will ever be beautiful and presentable. When nothing is beautiful and presentable, nothing can be unworthy of publishing either. My personality isn’t curated; why should my personal website be so?
