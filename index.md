### Which line-art tools can be used under Copics without smearing?
When you’re planning to color your piece in Copics or other alcohol markers, your line tool must be alcohol-resistant. Alcohol-based inks (e.g. Sakura Pigma, Speedball pigmented acrylic) and most inks designed to be water-resistant will smear.

Some Copic-safe options include…
1. Copic Gasenfude brush pen (beware of long dry times)
2. Water-based Tombow ABT brush markers
3. Pilot Iroshizuku Takesumi black ink (safe for fountain pens)
4. [Noodler’s Bulletproof Black ink](https://noodlersink.com/about-us/noodlers-durable-ink-classification/) (water-resistant and safe for fountain pens)
5. Yasutomo Black Sumi ink (and, presumably, other similar soot-based sumi inks). Quick-drying and water-resistant when dry.

## How Records Retention works
I spent a few years of my professional life developing workflows and custom code to support regulatory Records Retention (RR) efforts within a document management/content management system which I administered for a private financial institution. Here's an introduction to some of the basic concepts of RR.

### Definitions
1. **Document**	Information on a client or account organized into a static (unchanging) visual.
2. **Record**	Information on a client or account, often recorded in a database (application database or custom database). Because a record is not necessarily organized in a static visual like a document, the information may vary in how it is displayed/processed/used. A document is a type of record, but a record is not necessarily a document.
3. **Doc/Record Type**	A category of document or record. All documents/records should fall into a single type. “Miscellaneous” is not a type.
4. **Retention Period**		The duration of time after which the record should be deleted following its Cutoff Date.
5. **Cutoff Date**	 The date/time when the timer starts counting down on a record to be deleted. For many records, this is its creation date.
6. **Retention Trigger**	An event that occurs to trigger the application of a Retention Date. E.g. when a client leaves your institution.
7. **Quality Assurance (QA)**	The process of ensuring that the correct document type is attributed to each document/record.
8. **Records Manager**	The lucky person who gets to hit “Delete” on records that have reached the end of their retention period.
9. **Metadata**		Some people think of these as “index fields.” This is information about the record/document that contains your client’s data. E.g. the date that the record was created, the date it was last modified, the client account # that it relates to, its Document Type… etc. 

### How RR works
RR works by defining Document/Record Types, deciding what events might cause them to be able to be destroyed, and determining how long they must be kept before they can be destroyed. I.e. a Document is assigned a Document Type, which determine its Cutoff Date and its Retention Period.  

### Why RR?
1. To reduce the risk of destroying data when it could still be valuable 
2. To reduce the legal risks associated with retaining data for longer than needed (subpoenas, regulations) 
3. To align with government (domestic or international) regulations and guidelines 

### Steps to implementing RR
1. Determine your Document Types. 
2. Decide the Retention Triggers that would cause the countdown timer to start on each Document Type. 
	a. Usually these can be grouped into two categories: Doc Types that start their retention period immediately after creation; and Doc Types that start their retention period after a certain event transpires (e.g. a client leaving the institution, closing an account, etc.) 
3. Apply the metadata that will signal to automated systems when a document is ready for Retention. 
	a. For old records, you may have to write automated and/or manual procedures that apply this metadata retroactively. 
	b. Once you’ve determined the metadata needed for RR, all records going forward should have that metadata applied to them from the moment they are created. 
4. Write procedures (automated or manual) for sending records into the Retention phases of their lifecycle, based on the metadata applied in 3. 
5. Let your Records Manager(s) hit “delete.” They will do this on a regular (e.g. monthly) basis going forward.

### Best practices for RR
1. A record should not change during its Retention Period. If it is changing after it’s already been sent to Retention, that’s a likely signal that the Cutoff Date you’ve given it is too early in its lifecycle. 
2. Keep all client records in a dedicated system/location that has built-in retention features (such as a feature for setting Retention Periods). Don’t allow internal users to keep any client-related records on their desktops, in network drives, or in other locations where the records will be difficult to automatically catalog. 
3. If the only possible Document Type for a record is “Miscellaneous,” that probably means that it’s not actually needed, and can be destroyed immediately without even going into Retention. 
4. Restrict the UI of document submissions so that it’s very difficult for users to accidentally attribute documents/information to the wrong client 
5. When users type in a client ID, the client’s name should pop up as verification. Use "double-check" features like this to help users input better data.
6. When choosing a Records Manager, look for a minimalist. A person who likes to destroy old records is hard to find, but valuable. When other people get too scared to destroy old records, this person should be able to remind them why old records are not needed (and why they can be a liability). 
7. While much QA can be accomplished automatically with the right tools, some documents may need to be looked at manually (e.g. if they have inconsistent visual templates that cannot be OCR’d). The best approach to manual QA is actually a hybrid; give your QA team automatic tools that present the narrowest possible options to select using whatever the automated system can identify on its own.

### Technologies to help RR projects go smoother
A good RR tool allows you to define Document Types, Retention Triggers, and Retention Periods. It should automatically notify the Records Manager when records have reached their Delete Date. It should allow for optional collection of Metadata on records that have been deleted in the past. 

1. Some file directory scraping programs help analyze and categorize the documents that exist on hard drives, network drives, cloud document stores, etc. 
2. Some document management systems have dedicated RR functions that make it easy to automate RR.
3. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools can help identify metadata on documents that don’t already have it. 

## Heuristics for data processing
I learned to weild heuristic questioning as a writing tutor in college and found them endlessly helpful for thinking through problems with tutees or for my own benefit. They're especially helpful in brainstorming the possible consequences of running processes at scale. HOWEVER, heuristic questions can oversimplify problems (it's what they're designed to do). Use the following heuristics as one of many tools in your coding/designing toolbelt.

### Error handling
When accounting for possible errors, ask yourself the following questions (the answer to each should be "yes"):
1. Can the system continue processing subsequent records after throwing an error?
2. Can the errored record be recovered automatically on the next processing run?
3. Is the error reported in a timely manner to allow for appropriate human intervention?
4. Is the error isolated from causing downstream effects in other systems?

# Miscellany
As a data governance nerd I'm compelled to proclaim "'MISCELLANEOUS' IS NOT A CATEGORY." And yet, here we are.
## Day hike itinerary
A printable PDF I created for day hikes. I always make 3 copies:
- 1 copy to leave with an emergency contact
- 1 copy to leave (folded) in the car at the trailhead for park authorities
- 1 copy to take on the trail to stay on schedule and on route

It also helps with planning. Please use it, and be safe out there :)

## Favorite quotes

- "The principles may be simple, but many who discover principles are quick to confuse them with applications. To discover a common principle is the first lesson. To apply it is the work of a lifetime. To confuse the discovery with that lifetime is the business model of Medium.com, and discernibly not the business of the serious commuter." -- from *The City Commute: The Art & Science of Life's Most Tedious Journey* by Peter Hunt Welch

## Recipes I make when my parents are over for dinner
These recipes serve (at least) 4 people and still taste good with onions, garlic, and mushrooms removed (allergies are a bummer). I get garlic-free and onion-free stocks, sauces and dressings from [Fody Foods](https://www.fodyfoods.com/)

- Chicken saltimbocca; from Trisha’s Table; by Trisha Yearwood; pg 108
- Fettuccine Alfredo with Salmon and asparagus; from The Joy of Cooking; by Irma S Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, and Ethan Becker; pg 327

## Why is your personal website just one big Markdown doc?
**It’s lightweight and easy to update**

What it says on the tin. Unnecessarily bloated websites are exhausting to maintain *and view*.

**It’s free**

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), which natively supports Markdown (.md) files with readable styling out of the box. I highly recommend it for a no-frills content delivery platform, especially if you’re familiar with or want to learn git.

For a free service with more frills (functionality), I recommend [Wordpress.com](wordpress.com). Wordpress is likely better for typical blogging or online portfolio needs.

**It’s a perfectionism blocker**

When everything is in one giant, ever-growing Markdown document, nothing will ever be beautiful and presentable. When nothing is beautiful and presentable, nothing can be unworthy of publishing either. My personality isn’t curated; why should my personal website be so?

**Ctrl+F**

Search is built into every browser. If all content is on a single page, there’s no need to install a search plugin that will show ads for the first handful of results.
